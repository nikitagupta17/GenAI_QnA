# Questions on Vector Database

## 1. What are vector databases, and how do they differ from traditional relational databases?

**Answer:**
Vector databases store and query high-dimensional vector embeddings, optimized for similarity search rather than exact matches.

**Key Differences:** Store vectors instead of structured data, use similarity metrics (cosine, euclidean) instead of SQL queries, optimized for approximate nearest neighbor search rather than ACID transactions.

**Use Cases:** Semantic search, recommendation systems, RAG applications, image/video retrieval, and AI-powered applications requiring similarity matching.

## 2. Explain how vector embeddings are generated and their role in vector databases.

**Answer:**
Vector embeddings are dense numerical representations created by neural networks (BERT, sentence transformers, CNNs) that encode semantic meaning in continuous space.

**Generation:** Text → Embedding Model → Dense Vector (e.g., 768 dimensions for BERT)

**Role in VectorDB:** Embeddings enable semantic similarity search, clustering, and nearest neighbor retrieval for AI applications.

**Benefits:** Capture semantic relationships, enable cross-modal search, and provide efficient similarity computation.

## 3. What are the key challenges in indexing and searching through high-dimensional vector spaces?

**Answer:**
**Curse of Dimensionality:** Distance metrics become less discriminative in high dimensions, all points appear equidistant.

**Computational Complexity:** Brute force search is O(n×d) which doesn't scale to millions of vectors.

**Memory Requirements:** Storing and loading large vector collections efficiently.

**Solutions:** Approximate algorithms (HNSW, IVF), dimensionality reduction, quantization, and specialized indexing structures.

## 4. How do you evaluate the performance of a vector database in terms of search efficiency and accuracy?

**Answer:**
**Accuracy Metrics:** Recall@K (percentage of true neighbors found), precision@K, mean average precision.

**Efficiency Metrics:** Query latency, throughput (queries per second), index build time, memory usage.

**Trade-offs:** Balance between search speed and accuracy, configure parameters for application requirements.

**Benchmarking:** Use standard datasets (SIFT, GloVe) for consistent performance comparison across different systems.

## 5. Can you describe a scenario where you would prefer using a vector database over a traditional database?

**Answer:**
**Semantic Search Application:** Building a document search system where users want conceptually similar results, not exact keyword matches.

**Why Vector DB:** Traditional databases can't understand "car" and "automobile" are similar, while vector embeddings capture semantic relationships.

**Benefits:** Natural language queries, better user experience, handles synonyms and context, enables AI-powered search experiences.

**Example:** Customer support knowledge base where questions like "reset password" should match "forgot login credentials."

## 6. What are some popular vector databases available today, and what unique features do they offer?

**Answer:**
**Pinecone:** Managed cloud service, auto-scaling, hybrid search capabilities, easy integration.

**Weaviate:** Open-source, GraphQL API, built-in vectorization, multi-modal support.

**Milvus:** Open-source, horizontal scaling, GPU acceleration, enterprise features.

**FAISS:** Facebook's library, research-focused, various algorithms, CPU/GPU support.

**Chroma:** Lightweight, developer-friendly, local development, Python-native.

## 7. How do vector databases support machine learning workflows, particularly in deploying AI models?

**Answer:**
**Feature Storage:** Store pre-computed embeddings for fast inference, avoid recomputation during serving.

**Real-time Inference:** Enable similarity-based recommendations, semantic search in production applications.

**Model Serving:** Support RAG systems, few-shot learning examples retrieval, contextual AI responses.

**MLOps Integration:** Version embeddings, monitor performance, update indices with new data.

## 8. What techniques can be employed to ensure the scalability of a vector database as the dataset grows?

**Answer:**
**Horizontal Scaling:** Distribute vectors across multiple nodes using sharding strategies.

**Indexing Optimization:** Use hierarchical indices, compress vectors, implement lazy loading.

**Caching:** Cache frequent queries, implement smart prefetching strategies.

**Hardware Optimization:** GPU acceleration for similarity computation, SSD storage for fast access.

## 9. How can you handle vector data that may have different dimensionalities or representations?

**Answer:**
**Dimensionality Standardization:** Project all vectors to common dimension using learned transformations or padding/truncation.

**Multiple Collections:** Store different embedding types in separate collections with appropriate indices.

**Metadata Filtering:** Use metadata to distinguish vector types before similarity search.

**Adapter Layers:** Train transformation layers to map between different embedding spaces.

## 10. What role does vector similarity play in applications like recommendation systems or natural language processing?

**Answer:**
**Recommendation Systems:** Find similar users or items by computing vector similarity, enable collaborative filtering and content-based recommendations.

**NLP Applications:** Semantic search, document clustering, duplicate detection, query understanding.

**Similarity Metrics:** Cosine similarity for direction, Euclidean for magnitude, dot product for optimization.

**Applications:** "Users who liked this also liked," semantic document search, chatbot response matching.
