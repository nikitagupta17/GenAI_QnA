## 7. What is differential privacy and how is it applied to AI?

**Answer:**

**Definition:**
Differential privacy is a mathematical framework that provides strong privacy guarantees by ensuring that the inclusion or exclusion of any individual's data doesn't significantly affect the output of an analysis.

**Core Concepts:**
- **ε-differential privacy**: Quantifies privacy loss (smaller ε = stronger privacy)
- **Noise Addition**: Add calibrated random noise to outputs
- **Sensitivity**: Maximum change from adding/removing one record
- **Composition**: Privacy guarantees degrade with multiple queries

**Applications in AI:**

**1. Training Data Protection:**
- **DP-SGD**: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent
- **Gradient Clipping**: Limit influence of individual examples
- **Noise Injection**: Add noise to gradients during training
- **Privacy Budget**: Track cumulative privacy loss

**2. Model Inference:**
- **Private Aggregation**: Combine predictions with privacy guarantees
- **Noisy Responses**: Add noise to model outputs
- **Query Limitations**: Restrict number of queries per user
- **Synthetic Data**: Generate private synthetic datasets

**Implementation Example:**
```python
def dp_sgd_step(gradients, privacy_budget, sensitivity):
    # Clip gradients to bound sensitivity
    clipped_gradients = clip_gradients(gradients, sensitivity)
    
    # Add Gaussian noise calibrated to privacy budget
    noise_scale = sensitivity / privacy_budget
    noisy_gradients = add_gaussian_noise(clipped_gradients, noise_scale)
    
    return noisy_gradients
```

**Trade-offs:**
- **Privacy vs. Utility**: Stronger privacy often reduces model performance
- **Composition Costs**: Multiple operations consume privacy budget
- **Parameter Tuning**: Balancing noise levels and utility
- **Implementation Complexity**: Requires careful mathematical analysis
