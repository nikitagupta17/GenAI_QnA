## 5. Describe your experience with model fine-tuning. What worked and what didn't?

**Answer:**
*(Adapt with your actual experience)*

**Project Context:**
"I fine-tuned a domain-specific model for legal document analysis, starting from a base LLaMA-7B model to create a specialized legal AI assistant."

**What Worked Well:**

**1. Data Quality Focus:**
- **Success**: Curated high-quality legal documents from verified sources
- **Impact**: Achieved 85% accuracy on legal question answering vs. 60% with base model
- **Lesson**: Data quality matters more than quantity for fine-tuning

**2. Parameter-Efficient Approach:**
```python
# LoRA configuration that worked well
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=16,                    # Found sweet spot for legal domain
    lora_alpha=32,          # 2x rank for stability
    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj", "k_proj", "o_proj"],
    lora_dropout=0.1,
    bias="none"
)
```
- **Success**: Reduced training time by 70% compared to full fine-tuning
- **Impact**: Maintained base model capabilities while adding domain expertise

**3. Evaluation Strategy:**
- **Success**: Created comprehensive test suite with legal experts
- **Impact**: Caught subtle domain-specific errors that automated metrics missed

**What Didn't Work:**

**1. Initial Over-Aggressive Training:**
- **Mistake**: Started with high learning rate (5e-4) and long training
- **Result**: Model forgot general capabilities (catastrophic forgetting)
- **Solution**: Reduced to 2e-5 and added regularization

**2. Insufficient Validation:**
- **Mistake**: Small validation set led to overfitting
- **Result**: Great validation scores but poor real-world performance
- **Solution**: Increased validation set and added cross-validation

**3. Prompt Format Mismatch:**
- **Mistake**: Fine-tuning data format didn't match inference prompts
- **Result**: Inconsistent performance between training and deployment
- **Solution**: Aligned training and inference prompt templates exactly

**Key Learnings:**
- **Start Conservative**: Lower learning rates and shorter training initially
- **Monitor Closely**: Track both domain-specific and general capabilities
- **Test Thoroughly**: Real-world testing with domain experts is crucial
- **Iterate Quickly**: Small experiments beats one large training run

## 6. How do you optimize costs while maintaining quality in LLM applications?

**Answer:**

**Cost Optimization Strategy:**

**1. Model Selection Optimization:**
```python
def select_optimal_model(task, quality_threshold, budget):
    models = [
        {"name": "gpt-4", "cost": 0.06, "quality": 0.95},
        {"name": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "cost": 0.002, "quality": 0.85},
        {"name": "local-7b", "cost": 0.0001, "quality": 0.75}
    ]
    
    for model in sorted(models, key=lambda x: x["cost"]):
        if model["quality"] >= quality_threshold:
            return model
    
    return None  # No model meets requirements
```

**Model Cascading:**
- **Simple Queries**: Route to smaller, cheaper models first
- **Complex Tasks**: Escalate to larger models only when needed
- **Quality Gating**: Use confidence scores to determine escalation

**2. Prompt Optimization:**

**Token Efficiency:**
- **Concise Prompts**: Remove unnecessary words while maintaining clarity
- **Template Reuse**: Standardized prompts reduce token consumption
- **Context Compression**: Summarize long conversations to fit context windows
- **Smart Truncation**: Remove less relevant information strategically

**Example Optimization:**
```python
# Before: 150 tokens
prompt_verbose = """
Please analyze the following customer feedback and provide a detailed 
summary of the sentiment, key issues mentioned, and recommendations 
for improvement. Here is the feedback: {feedback}
"""

# After: 45 tokens
prompt_optimized = """
Analyze feedback sentiment, issues, and improvement suggestions:
{feedback}
"""
```

**3. Caching Strategies:**

**Response Caching:**
```python
class ResponseCache:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}
        self.similarity_threshold = 0.95
    
    def get_response(self, prompt):
        # Check for exact or similar cached responses
        for cached_prompt, response in self.cache.items():
            if self.similarity(prompt, cached_prompt) > self.similarity_threshold:
                return response
        
        return None
    
    def cache_response(self, prompt, response):
        self.cache[prompt] = response
```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- 40% cost reduction through caching common queries
- 60% faster response times for cached results
- Improved user experience with consistent answers

**4. Infrastructure Optimization:**

**Batch Processing:**
- **Request Batching**: Process multiple requests together
- **Scheduled Processing**: Handle non-urgent tasks during off-peak hours
- **Parallel Processing**: Optimize throughput for bulk operations

**Resource Management:**
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale compute resources based on demand
- **Spot Instances**: Use cheaper compute for non-critical workloads
- **Resource Pooling**: Share infrastructure across multiple applications

**5. Quality-Cost Trade-offs:**

**Tiered Service Levels:**
- **Premium**: GPT-4 for critical applications
- **Standard**: GPT-3.5-turbo for most use cases
- **Basic**: Smaller models for simple tasks

**Dynamic Quality Adjustment:**
```python
def adjust_quality_for_budget(monthly_budget, current_spend, days_remaining):
    if current_spend / monthly_budget > days_remaining / 30:
        # Approaching budget limit - reduce quality temporarily
        return "cost_optimized"
    else:
        return "standard_quality"
```

**Results Achieved:**
- 50% cost reduction without significant quality loss
- 99.5% uptime with optimized infrastructure
- Scalable architecture supporting 10x traffic growth

- Large model loading time
- Inefficient tokenization and inference pipeline

**Solutions Implemented:**
```python
# Model optimization approach
class OptimizedInference:
    def __init__(self):
        # Keep model warm in memory
        self.model = self.load_optimized_model()
        self.tokenizer = self.load_fast_tokenizer()
    
    def load_optimized_model(self):
        # Use quantized model for faster inference
        model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
            "model-name",
            torch_dtype=torch.float16,  # Half precision
            device_map="auto"           # Automatic GPU placement
        )
        return model.eval()  # Set to inference mode
```

**Technical Improvements:**

            "do_sample": False,     # Deterministic for some use cases
            "seed": 42              # Fixed seed for reproducibility
        }
    
    def generate_consistent(self, prompt):
        # Add consistency prompt prefix
        consistent_prompt = f"""
        Provide a single, definitive answer to the following question.
        Be consistent and precise in your response.
        
        Question: {prompt}
        Answer:"""
        
        return self.model.generate(
            consistent_prompt,

**Solutions Implemented:**

**Smart Routing:**
```python
class ModelRouter:
    def route_request(self, request):
        complexity_score = self.analyze_complexity(request.prompt)
        
        if complexity_score < 0.3:
            return "small_model"    # 90% cheaper
        elif complexity_score < 0.7:
            return "medium_model"   # 50% cheaper
        else:
            return "large_model"    # Most capable
    
    def analyze_complexity(self, prompt):
        factors = [
            len(prompt.split()),           # Length
            count_technical_terms(prompt), # Domain complexity
            has_multi_step_reasoning(prompt) # Reasoning required
        ]
        return calculate_complexity_score(factors)
```
