# Large Language Models (LLMs) - Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is a Large Language Model (LLM)?

**Answer:**
A Large Language Model is a type of neural network trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. LLMs use transformer architecture and have billions of parameters, enabling them to perform various language tasks without task-specific training.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Trained on diverse text corpora (books, articles, websites)
- Use self-attention mechanisms
- Can perform multiple tasks through prompting
- Exhibit emergent abilities at scale

**Examples**: GPT series, BERT, LLaMA, PaLM, Claude

## 2. Explain the Transformer architecture and its importance.

**Answer:**
The Transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (2017) that revolutionized NLP and became the foundation for modern LLMs.

**Key Components:**
- **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention mechanisms running in parallel
- **Positional Encoding**: Provides sequence order information
- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Process attended information
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training

**Advantages:**
- Parallelizable training (faster than RNNs)
- Captures long-range dependencies
- Scalable to very large sizes
- Transfer learning capabilities

## 3. What is the difference between encoder-only, decoder-only, and encoder-decoder models?

**Answer:**

**Encoder-Only (e.g., BERT):**
- Processes entire input sequence simultaneously
- Bidirectional context understanding
- Best for: Classification, sentiment analysis, question answering
- Uses masked language modeling for training

**Decoder-Only (e.g., GPT):**
- Generates text autoregressively (left-to-right)
- Unidirectional, causal attention
- Best for: Text generation, completion, dialogue
- Uses next-token prediction for training

**Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART):**
- Combines both architectures
- Encoder processes input, decoder generates output
- Best for: Translation, summarization, text-to-text tasks
- Uses various training objectives

## 4. Explain the concept of attention and self-attention.

**Answer:**

**Attention Mechanism:**
- Allows the model to focus on relevant parts of the input when making predictions
- Computes weighted representations based on relevance
- Solves the bottleneck problem in sequence-to-sequence models

**Self-Attention:**
- Each token attends to all other tokens in the same sequence
- Creates rich contextual representations
- Enables parallel processing

**Mathematical Intuition:**
- Query (Q): What am I looking for?
- Key (K): What information is available?
- Value (V): The actual information content
- Attention = softmax(QK^T / âˆšd_k)V

## 5. What are the different training phases of LLMs?

**Answer:**

**1. Pre-training:**
- Train on large, diverse text corpora

- Unsupervised learning (next-token prediction)
- Most computationally expensive phase

**2. Fine-tuning:**
- Adapt to specific tasks or domains
- Use smaller, task-specific datasets
- Supervised learning with labeled data
- Can be instruction-tuning or task-specific

**3. Alignment (RLHF - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback):**
- Align model outputs with human preferences
- Train reward model from human feedback
- Use reinforcement learning to optimize for human-preferred responses
- Improves safety and helpfulness

## 6. What is RLHF and why is it important?

**Answer:**
RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a technique to align AI models with human values and preferences.

**Process:**
1. **Collect Human Feedback**: Humans rank model outputs
2. **Train Reward Model**: Learn to predict human preferences
3. **RL Optimization**: Use PPO to maximize reward scores
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Repeat the process

**Benefits:**

## 8. What is in-context learning?

**Answer:**
In-context learning is the ability of LLMs to learn and perform new tasks simply by providing examples or instructions in the input prompt, without updating model parameters.
