# GenAI Fundamentals - Interview Questions & Answers

## 1. What is Generative AI?

**Answer:**
Generative AI is a subset of artificial intelligence that can create new content, including text, images, audio, video, and code, based on patterns learned from training data. Unlike traditional AI that classifies or predicts, GenAI generates novel outputs that resemble human-created content.

**Key Points to Mention:**
- Uses deep learning models, particularly neural networks
- Learns patterns from vast amounts of training data
- Can produce creative and contextually relevant content
- Applications include chatbots, image generation, code completion, and content creation

## 2. How does Generative AI differ from traditional AI?

**Answer:**
Traditional AI focuses on classification, prediction, and decision-making based on existing data, while Generative AI creates new content. Traditional AI answers "what is this?" or "what will happen?", whereas GenAI answers "what could be?"

**Key Differences:**
- **Purpose**: Traditional AI analyzes and classifies; GenAI creates and generates
- **Output**: Traditional AI provides labels/predictions; GenAI produces new content
- **Training**: Traditional AI learns to map inputs to known outputs; GenAI learns distributions to generate new samples
- **Applications**: Traditional AI for recommendations, fraud detection; GenAI for content creation, design assistance

## 3. What are the main types of Generative AI models?

**Answer:**
The main types include:

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Generate text (GPT, BERT, LLaMA)
2. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Generate images and media
3. **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**: Generate images and data compression
4. **Diffusion Models**: Generate high-quality images (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
5. **Transformer-based Models**: Multi-modal generation (text, images, code)

## 4. Explain the concept of tokens in language models.

**Answer:**
Tokens are the basic units of text that language models process. A token can be a word, part of a word, punctuation, or special characters.

**Key Points:**
- Tokenization breaks text into manageable pieces for the model
- Common methods: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), WordPiece, SentencePiece
- Token limits define model context windows (e.g., GPT-4 has 8K-32K token limits)
- Understanding tokens is crucial for prompt engineering and cost calculation

**Example**: "Hello world!" might be tokenized as ["Hello", " world", "!"]

## 5. What is the difference between fine-tuning and prompt engineering?

**Answer:**

**Fine-tuning:**
- Modifying model weights through additional training on specific datasets
- Requires computational resources and training data
- Creates a specialized version of the model
- More permanent and task-specific adaptation

**Prompt Engineering:**
- Crafting effective input prompts to get desired outputs
- No model modification required
- Uses the pre-trained model as-is
- More flexible and immediate approach

**When to use each:**
- Fine-tuning: When you need consistent behavior for specific tasks
- Prompt Engineering: For general use cases and quick experimentation

## 6. What is few-shot learning in the context of GenAI?

**Answer:**
Few-shot learning is the ability of AI models to learn and perform new tasks with only a few examples, without requiring extensive retraining.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Zero-shot**: Performing tasks without any examples
- **One-shot**: Learning from a single example
- **Few-shot**: Learning from a small number of examples (typically 2-10)

**Benefits:**
- Rapid adaptation to new tasks
- Reduced need for large training datasets
- Cost-effective deployment for specialized use cases

**Example**: Showing a model 3 examples of email classification, then asking it to classify new emails

## 7. What are the key challenges in Generative AI?

**Answer:**
Major challenges include:

1. **Hallucination**: Models generating false or nonsensical information
2. **Bias**: Reflecting societal biases from training data
3. **Computational Requirements**: High costs and energy consumption
4. **Data Quality**: Need for large, high-quality training datasets
5. **Interpretability**: Difficulty understanding model decision-making
6. **Safety and Alignment**: Ensuring outputs align with human values
7. **Intellectual Property**: Questions about content ownership and copyright

## 8. Explain the concept of model parameters.

**Answer:**
Model parameters are the learnable weights and biases in neural networks that are adjusted during training to minimize loss and improve performance.

**Key Points:**
- **Size Correlation**: More parameters generally mean more capability but also more computational requirements
- **Examples**: GPT-3 has 175B parameters, GPT-4 estimated 1.7T parameters
- **Trade-offs**: Larger models are more capable but slower and more expensive to run
- **Not just about size**: Architecture and training quality also matter significantly

## 9. What is transfer learning in GenAI?

**Answer:**
Transfer learning involves taking a pre-trained model and adapting it for a new, related task, leveraging knowledge learned from the original training.

**Benefits:**
- Faster training times
- Better performance with less data
- Cost-effective compared to training from scratch
- Enables specialized applications

**Common Approaches:**
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Feature extraction from pre-trained layers
- Using foundation models as starting points

## 10. How do you evaluate the quality of generated content?

**Answer:**
Quality evaluation involves multiple metrics and approaches:

**Automated Metrics:**
- **Perplexity**: Measures how well the model predicts text
- **BLEU/ROUGE**: Compare generated text to reference texts
- **Inception Score**: For image quality evaluation
- **FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance)**: Measures image generation quality

**Human Evaluation:**
- Relevance and coherence
- Factual accuracy
- Style and tone appropriateness
- Creative quality

**Hybrid Approaches:**
- A/B testing with users
- Expert review panels
- Automated fact-checking tools
- Bias detection algorithms
