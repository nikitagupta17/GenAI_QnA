# Questions on Word and Sentence Embeddings

## 1. What is the fundamental concept of embeddings in machine learning, and how do they represent information in a more compact form compared to raw input data?

**Answer:**
Embeddings are dense vector representations that map high-dimensional categorical or discrete data into lower-dimensional continuous space while preserving semantic relationships.

**Compactness:** Transform sparse one-hot vectors (vocab_size dimensions) into dense vectors (typically 100-768 dimensions), capturing semantic meaning in fewer parameters.

**Benefits:** Enable arithmetic operations on concepts, measure semantic similarity, and provide efficient input representations for neural networks.

## 2. Compare and contrast word embeddings and sentence embeddings. How do their applications differ, and what considerations come into play when choosing between them?

**Answer:**
**Word Embeddings:** Represent individual words in vector space, capture lexical relationships, fixed representation regardless of context.

**Sentence Embeddings:** Represent entire sentences/paragraphs, capture compositional meaning, context-dependent representations.

**Applications:** Word embeddings for similarity tasks, analogy reasoning; sentence embeddings for document classification, semantic search, text clustering.

**Choice:** Use word embeddings for token-level tasks, sentence embeddings for document-level understanding.

## 3. Explain the concept of contextual embeddings. How do models like BERT generate contextual embeddings, and in what scenarios are they advantageous compared to traditional word embeddings?

**Answer:**
Contextual embeddings generate different representations for the same word based on surrounding context, unlike static word embeddings.

**BERT Mechanism:** Uses bidirectional transformer encoder with self-attention to create context-aware representations for each token position.

**Advantages:** Handles polysemy (bank = financial vs river), captures syntax and semantics simultaneously, better performance on downstream tasks requiring context understanding like NER and QA.

## 4. Discuss the challenges and strategies involved in generating cross-modal embeddings, where information from multiple modalities, such as text and image, is represented in a shared embedding space.

**Answer:**

**Retrieval Metrics:** Precision@K, recall@K, MAP, NDCG for information retrieval tasks.

**Visualization:** t-SNE, UMAP for qualitative assessment of semantic clustering.

## 13. Explain the concept of triplet loss in the context of embedding learning.

**Answer:**
Triplet loss trains embeddings by minimizing distance between anchor and positive examples while maximizing distance to negative examples.

**Formula:** L = max(0, d(anchor, positive) - d(anchor, negative) + margin)

**Purpose:** Creates embedding space where similar items cluster together and dissimilar items are pushed apart.

**Applications:** Face recognition, image retrieval, metric learning for semantic similarity tasks.

## 14. In loss functions like triplet loss or contrastive loss, what is the significance of the margin parameter?

**Answer:**
Margin defines the minimum required distance between positive and negative pairs, controlling the separation boundary in embedding space.
