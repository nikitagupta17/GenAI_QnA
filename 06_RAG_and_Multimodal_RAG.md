# Questions on RAG and Multimodal RAG

## 1. What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?

**Answer:**
RAG combines retrieval-based and generative approaches by first retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base, then using that information to augment the generation process.

**Process:** Query → Document Retrieval → Context Augmentation → LLM Generation → Response

**Benefits:** Reduces hallucination, provides up-to-date information, enables citation of sources, and improves factual accuracy without retraining the base model.

## 2. Can you explain the text generation difference between RAG and direct language models?

**Answer:**
**Direct LLMs:** Generate responses solely from pre-trained knowledge encoded in model parameters, limited by training data cutoff.

**RAG:** Retrieves external documents first, then generates responses using both parametric knowledge and retrieved context.

**Key Difference:** RAG provides access to current information and specific domain knowledge while direct LLMs rely only on memorized training data.

## 3. What are some common applications of RAG in AI?

**Answer:**
**Question Answering:** Enterprise knowledge bases, customer support systems
